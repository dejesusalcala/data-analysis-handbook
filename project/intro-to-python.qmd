In this chapter we'll cover some of the basics of Python. This will include using Python as a calculator, variables in Python, loops, conditionals, and functions. This will help form a basic understanding of the fundamentals of programming with Python's syntax

## Variables and Assignments

## Loops in Python

## Conditionals

## Functions

## Classes in Python

A **Class** in Python acts as a "blueprint" for creating objects. They are extremely useful for the reusability and organization of code.

An **instance** is an object that belongs to a class.

Let's consider the following example

```{python}
# Create a class Square
class Square():
    
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length = length

    def area(self):
        return self.length*self.length

    def perimiter(self):
        return self.length*4
```

In this case we have created a `class`

```{python}
square1 = Square(23)
square2 = Square(23.123)
```

```{python}
square1.length
```

```{python}
square1.perimiter()
```


```{python}
square1.area()
```

```{julia}
2+2
```
