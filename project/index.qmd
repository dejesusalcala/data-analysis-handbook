# Preface {.unnumbered}

The purpose of this book is to organize the notes from a couple of data analysis courses that I've taken. In a way, I want to merge both into one that can be a comprehensize guide to data analysis. This will be in an online book format that I believe can be beneficial for both learning and reviewing some of the material.  

This book will cover various data analysis topics such data collection, data storage,  cleaning, visualizations. The book will also cover useful tools such as SQL, R, Python, and a few others. As I continue to learn more about data analytics I would also be able to add more content to refine the book.
