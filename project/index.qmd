# Preface {.unnumbered}

The purpose of this book is to organize the notes from the Data Analysis Bootcamp. The class goes through various data analysis topics such as Python, SQL, data collection, and much more. I want to use this book as a way to better understand these topics and so that I can use these notes as a future reference.
