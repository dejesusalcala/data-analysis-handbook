When people talk about "data" what exactly do they mean? To understand data we'll discuss three perspectives about the notion of data:

- How do we store and organize data?
- What are some of the things that analysts tend to think when discussing data?
- How do programs handle data?

So, in general, what is data? What is data analysis? Who is a data analyst and what do they do?  We can define these terms as the following

Data
: In general, *data* are facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.

Data Analysis
: *Data analysis* is the collection, transformation, organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

Data Analyst
: A *data analyst* is someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to help make informed decisions.

Data Analytics
: *Data analytics* is the science of data.

Let's take a look at the following example:

- - -

Example:
: *Luke Skywalker* grew up in *Tatooine*. He is a force sensitive *male*, *1.72 meters* tall, and uses a lightsaber.

There are numerous ways to store this data:

- Pen and paper
- Photo
- Audio
- Word Document
- Plain text file

- - -

In a compter, this data will be stored in a **file**.

File
: A *file* is simply a block of computer memory. It's a collection of related data typically organized as records.
 
    - can be a few bytes to gigabytes in size
    - a file format is a way of interpreting the bytes in a file

File Extension
: A *file extension* is the suffix that appears at the end of the file name and it indicates the type of file (i.e. the type of file).

    - *.txt*, *.pdf*, *.docx*, *.mp3*, *.jpg* are all examples of file extensions.   

Data analysis can be broken down into multiple parts and each plays a key role. These parts together define what's often referred to as the **data analysis process**.

1. **Identify** the question or problem 
2. **Collect** the data
3. **Clean** the data
4. **Analyze** the data
5. **Interpret** the results
