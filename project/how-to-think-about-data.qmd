When a data analyst thinks about data they will likely view that data in a table format with some visualization of that data

A data analyst likely thinks of mathematical and statistical abstractions. This may involve putting things in terms of relationships or associations, perhaps theoretical mathematical models that take various forms; **linear**, **quadratic**, **non-parametric**.

In general, we should have the following in our minds when thinking of variables in our data

- quantitative (numerical) vs. qualitative (categorical)
- continuous vs. discrete
- ordinal vs nominal
- scales: ratio, interval
- dependent vs. independent
- descriptors (predictors) vs. response
- input vs. output
- correlations
- theoretical models (linear, quadratic, etc.)

Let's define some of these terms

Quantitative:
: Relating to, measuring, or measured by the quantity of something rather than its quality. This data is expressed in numbers and can be measured. **Quantitative** data is also referred to as **numerical** data.

**Quantitative** data is grouped into two main types; **continuous** and **discrete**.

Example
: The folllowing are all examples of quantitative data

- weight in pounds
- length in centimeters
- dollar value of a company's stocks


Qualitative:
: Relating to, measuring, or measured by the quality of something rather than its quantity. This data is usually expressed as labels, groups, or categories. **Qualitative** data is also referred to as **categorical** data.

**Qualitative** data is grouped into two main types; nominal or ordinal.

Continuous:
: Suppose $f$ is a function that's defined on a set $X$ of real numbers and $x_o \in X$. The $f$ is **continuous** at $x_o$ if 

$$
    \lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) = f(x_0).
$$

Then we say that $f$ is **continuous on the set** $X$ if it is continuous at each number in $X$.

What this definition is saying is that a function has no discontinuous points such as a *jump* or a *break* along a given interval. 

1. Jump discontinuity

$$
\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) \; \text{does not exist}
$$

2. Removable discontinuity 

$$
\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) \neq f(x_o)
$$

3. Infinite discontinuity

$$
\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) = \infty
$$

Discrete: 
: A numerical type of data that refers to distinct elements. In other words, objects or elements that are unconnected. Discrete elements almost always *finite*.

Ordinal:
: A categorical type of data that represents a group or category that does have an order or ranking.

Example:
: The following are some examples of ordinal data

- Education level (high school, bacehelor's, master's, etc.)
- Socioeconomic status (low, middle, upper)

Nominal:
: A categorical type of data that represents a group or category that does not have any order or ranking.

Example:
: The following are examples of nominal data

- Hair color (black, brown, blonde, etc.)
- Vehicle types (SUV, coupe, sedan, crossovers, etc.)
