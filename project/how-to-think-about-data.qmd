When a data analyst thinks about data they will likely view that data in a table format with some visualization of that data

A data analyst likely thinks of mathematical and statistical abstractions. This may involve putting things in terms of relationships or associations, perhaps theoretical mathematical models that take various forms; **linear**, **quadratic**, **non-parametric**.

In general, we should have the following in our minds when thinking of variables in our data

- quantitative vs. qualitative
- continuous vs. discrete
- numerical vs. categorical
- scales: ratio, interval, ordinal, nominal
- dependent vs. independent
- descriptors (predictors) vs, response
- input vs. output
- correlations
- theoretical models (linear, quadratic, etc.)

Let's define so of these terms

Quantitative:
: Relating to, measuring, or measured by the quantity of something rather than its quality.

Example
: The folllowing are all examples of quantitative data

- weight in pounds
- length in centimeters
- dollar value of a company's stocks


Qualitative:
: Relating to, measuring, or measured by the quality of something rather than its quantity.

Continuous:
: 

Discrete: 
: 

Numerical: 
:
