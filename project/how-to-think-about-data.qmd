When a data analyst thinks about data they will likely view that data in a table format with some visualization of that data

A data analyst likely thinks of mathematical and statistical abstractions. This may involve putting things in terms of relationships or associations, perhaps theoretical mathematical models that take various forms; **linear**, **quadratic**, **non-parametric**.

In general, we should have the following in our minds when thinking of variables in our data

- quantitative vs. qualitative
- continuous vs. discrete
- numerical vs. categorical
- scales: ratio, interval, ordinal, nominal
- dependent vs. independent
- descriptors (predictors) vs. response
- input vs. output
- correlations
- theoretical models (linear, quadratic, etc.)

Let's define some of these terms

Quantitative:
: Relating to, measuring, or measured by the quantity of something rather than its quality.

Example
: The folllowing are all examples of quantitative data

- weight in pounds
- length in centimeters
- dollar value of a company's stocks


Qualitative:
: Relating to, measuring, or measured by the quality of something rather than its quantity.

Continuous:
: Suppose $f$ is a function that's defined on a set $X$ of real numbers and $x_o \in X$. The $f$ is **continuous** at $x_o$ if 

$$
    \lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) = f(x_0).
$$

Then we say that $f$ is **continuous on the set** $X$ if it is continuous at each number in $X$.

What this definition is saying is that a function has no discontinuous points such as a *jump* or a *break* along a given interval. 

1. Jump discontinuity

$$
\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) \; \text{does not exist}
$$

2. Removable discontinuity 

$$
\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) \neq f(x_o)
$$

3. Infinite discontinuity

$$
\lim_{x \to x_0} f(x) = \infty
$$

Discrete:

Numerical:
